Mini CRM Platform for Xeno SDE Internship
This is a modern, full-stack Mini CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform built as part of the Xeno SDE Internship assignment. It features an AI-powered audience segmentation tool, asynchronous data processing, and a complete campaign management workflow, all deployed on a scalable, multi-cloud infrastructure.

üöÄ Live Demo
Frontend Application: https://xeno-sde-internship-2025-y5c6.vercel.app

Backend API Server: https://xeno-sde-internship-2025.onrender.com

(Note: The free-tier services may take a moment to "wake up" on the first visit.)

‚ú® Key Features
Asynchronous Data Ingestion: Scalable API endpoints for adding customers and orders using a RabbitMQ message queue, ensuring the API remains fast and responsive.

AI-Powered Audience Segmentation: Integrates with the Google Gemini API to translate natural language prompts (e.g., "high-value customers who are inactive") into complex, structured database queries.

Dynamic Rule Builder: A flexible UI for manually creating customer segments with multiple rules using AND/OR logic.

Live Audience Preview: Real-time calculation of the number of customers matching the defined rules without launching a campaign.

Asynchronous Campaign Delivery: A complete workflow to create and launch marketing campaigns. Message delivery is handled by a background worker, simulating interaction with a third-party vendor.

Campaign History & Statistics: A dashboard to view all past campaigns and their real-time delivery statistics (Total, Sent, Failed).

Secure Authentication: The platform is protected by Google OAuth 2.0, ensuring only authenticated users can manage data and campaigns.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The application is built on a decoupled, multi-service architecture designed for scalability and resilience. Each component is deployed to a service best suited for its role.
